## ✅ TypeScript Benefits You're Getting

- **Auto-completion** in your IDE for all APIs
- **Error prevention** for configuration mistakes  
- **Better refactoring** when you need to change APIs
- **Professional documentation** through type definitions
- **User confidence** from type-safe library usage

## 🎯 Your TypeScript is Production-Ready!

Your package now provides the same professional experience as major libraries like:
- `express` (has TypeScript support)
- `vue-i18n` (has TypeScript support)  
- `react-i18next` (has TypeScript support)

Users can confidently integrate your translation manager knowing they'll get proper IDE support and catch integration errors early.

Keep building awesome features! 🌍
